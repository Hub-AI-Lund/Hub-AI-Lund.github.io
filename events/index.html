The night will start of with a presentation from Lund University graduate and independent AI Safety Researcher Marcus Williams.
The presentation explores the potential for catastrophic or even existential (i.e. human extinction) risks from future advanced AI systems and why one might want to take these risks seriously. We will examine various potential difficulties in aligning and developing safe advanced AI systems along with several research agendas and initiatives aiming to reduce or mitigate these risks.
Through this overview, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the complex challenges surrounding advanced AI and the crucial work being done to safeguard our future.</p><hr><h2 id=from-pixels-to-possibilities-exploring-human-creativity-and-ai-in-game-design>From Pixels to Possibilities: Exploring human creativity and AI in game design</h2><h5 id=round_pushpin-e1406-ole-r√∂mers-v√§g-3-223-63-lund>&#x1f4cd; <strong>E:1406 Ole R√∂mers v√§g 3, 223 63 Lund</strong></h5><h5 id=date-march-27-2024-1800>&#x1f4c5; <strong>March 27 2024 18:00</strong></h5><h5 id=link-facebook-event-2>&#x1f517; <a href=https://fb.me/e/2bzBLs2ei>Facebook event</a></h5><p>Unlock the Next Level of Game Design: collaborate with AI to push the boundaries of your imagination, discover if AI is the ultimate player two for human creativity, and see the Evolutionary World Designer (EDDy) in action.

And contact tracing, which is traditionally done manually, made its way into the digital world. This approach finds out how the virus is spreading within any given population using proximity detection. Simply, the user is notified if there is any risk of crossing paths with someone who has a confirmed case of infection. Does it work? And what kind of challenges does it bring?
