Here&rsquo;s your chance to learn more! ChatGPT took the world by storm, popularising AI and allowing people to get creative about its usage opportunities. While some are talking about a revolution in AI, and Silicon Valley companies are racing about who will build the best Generative Pre-trained Transformer (hence GPT), this tool has already raised serious concerns and even bans in schools. The academic context faces many changes with this new technology, from easily accessible knowledge to cheating scandals - this tool sparked vivid discussions of applications in academia. We want to dig deeper into this topic by bringing together researchers and experts from different fields to talk about GPT-3 and NLP - how the technology is designed, what it can and cannot do, and how this technology might progress in the future - all in the context of academia.</p><hr><h2 id=python-workshop-series---intermediate>Python Workshop Series - Intermediate</h2><h5 id=round_pushpin-e1406-ole-r√∂mers-v√§g-3-223-63-lund-1>&#x1f4cd; <strong>E:1406 Ole R√∂mers v√§g 3, 223 63 Lund</strong></h5><h5 id=date-april-26--may-3-2023-1730>&#x1f4c5; <strong>April 26 & May 3 2023 17:30</strong></h5><h5 id=link-facebook-eventhttpsfbmee2ud46ca3o>&#x1f517; <a href=https://fb.me/e/2uD46CA3o>Facebook event</a></h5><p>Have you ever considered learning how to code and harness AI&rsquo;s power?

Are we living in a surveillance culture? What role do stakeholders play and where can we situate the users? Are we merely passive data generators or can we actively shape the data-generating process?

And contact tracing, which is traditionally done manually, made its way into the digital world. This approach finds out how the virus is spreading within any given population using proximity detection. Simply, the user is notified if there is any risk of crossing paths with someone who has a confirmed case of infection. Does it work? And what kind of challenges does it bring? Viktoriia Shubina, a PhD researcher at Tampere University, will shed some light on digital contact-tracing tech and discuss its limitations.</p><h5 id=link-click-here-to-see-the-recording-of-our-eventhttpsyoutubek15b3jauguy>&#x1f517; <a href=https://youtu.be/K15B3jAUGUY>Click here to see the recording of our event</a></h5><hr><h2 id=hub-ai-codes-python-meetup-with-compute-and-ai-lund>Hub AI codes: python meetup with COMPUTE and AI Lund</h2><h5 id=round_pushpin-online-10>&#x1f4cd; <strong>Online</strong></h5><h5 id=date-february-24-2021-1730>&#x1f4c5; <strong>February 24 2021 17:30</strong></h5><h5 id=link-facebook-eventhttpswwwfacebookcomevents456327352230830>&#x1f517; <a href=https://www.facebook.com/events/456327352230830/>Facebook event</a></h5><p>The third Python workshop in collaboration with AI Lund and COMPUTE.</p><hr><h2 id=hub-ai-talks-fredrik-heintz-on-trustworthy-human-centric-ai>Hub AI Talks: Fredrik Heintz on Trustworthy Human-Centric AI</h2><h5 id=round_pushpin-online-11>&#x1f4cd; <strong>Online</strong></h5><h5 id=date-february-17-2021-1730>&#x1f4c5; <strong>February 17 2021 17:30</strong></h5><h5 id=link-facebook-eventhttpswwwfacebookcomevents707166416646405>&#x1f517; <a href=https://www.facebook.com/events/707166416646405/>Facebook event</a></h5><p>Hub AI invites Dr Fredrik Heintz, an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Link√∂ping University, Sweden.
