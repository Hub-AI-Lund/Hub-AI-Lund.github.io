Our events range from guest lectures and panel discussions to Python workshops and social events. Since Hub AI hosts interdisciplinary events, we attract students with different backgrounds ranging from engineering, biotechnology and computer science to economics, political science and psychology</p></header></div></section><section id=two class="wrapper alt style2"><section class=spotlight><div class=image><img src=/educate.jpg alt></div><div class=content><h2>Guest Lectures</h2><p>One of our most common types of events are guest lectures or colloquiums. Such events revolve around one or several professionals who are invited to talk about a particular area related to AI. Some previous examples include Brain-Inspired Computing, AI in Diagnosing Mental Illness, Smart Cities, Thesis Writing or Entrepreneurship in Tech</p></div></section><section class=spotlight><div class=image><img src=/share.jpg alt></div><div class=content><h2>Panel Discussions</h2><p>Some topics make it more beneficial to have a discussion between several people to capture a wider perspective. Hence, we also host panel events.
