Our events range from guest lectures and panel discussions to Python workshops and social events. Since Hub AI hosts interdisciplinary events, we attract students with different backgrounds ranging from engineering, biotechnology and computer science to economics, political science and psychology</p></header></div></section><section id=two class="wrapper alt style2"><section class=spotlight><div class=image><img src=/educate.jpg alt></div><div class=content><h2>Guest Lectures</h2><p>One of our most common types of events are guest lectures or colloquiums. Such events revolve around one or several professionals who are invited to talk about a particular area related to AI. Some previous examples include Brain-Inspired Computing, AI in Diagnosing Mental Illness, Smart Cities, Thesis Writing or Entrepreneurship in Tech</p></div></section><section class=spotlight><div class=image><img src=/share.jpg alt></div><div class=content><h2>Panel Discussions</h2><p>Some topics make it more beneficial to have a discussion between several people to capture a wider perspective. Hence, we also host panel events. Our panel discussions welcome professionals, scholars or students to discuss topics such as Diversity in AI, AI and Sustainability or Life Science meets AI</p></div></section><section class=spotlight><div class=image><img src=/workshop.jpg alt></div><div class=content><h2>Python Workshops</h2><p>Each semester we host a series of Python workshops. There are six workshops in total with the first three being designed for beginners, while the remaining ones cover more complex concepts building on top of material covered in the previous workshops</p></div></section><section class=spotlight><div class=image><img src=/social.png alt></div><div class=content><h2>Social Events</h2><p>As an organization, we aim to create a community for like-minded people, which is why we also host less formal social events with greater flexibility in terms of exact format. Such events range from board game nights and pizza mingles to going hiking or bowling</p></div></section></section><section id=three class="wrapper style3 special"><div class=inner><header class=major><h2>The Board</h2><p>The board members are the main drivers shaping what type of events we host and are responsible for the day-to-day activities of the organization</p></header><ul class=features><li class=icon><h2><img src=team/Maja.JPG / class=headshot></h2><h2 style=text-align:center>President,<br>Maja</h2><p style=text-align:center>I am currently pursuing my Master of Laws.

In my role at Hub AI, I aim to connect the organization and students with industry leaders and innovators, fostering partnerships that showcase AI’s real-world applications. My goal is to create opportunities for members to gain valuable insights into AI’s transformative potential and its broader societal and economic implications.</p></li><li class=icon><h2><img src=team/anonymous.png / class=headshot></h2><h2 style=text-align:center>Head of Education,<br>Johan</h2><p style=text-align:center>My interests and studies in engineering risk management and mathematical statistics center around exploring the intersection of AI, mathematics, and practical applications. As Head of Education at Hub AI, I combine my passion for teaching with my interest for AI and programming, facilitating workshops that help others explore these fields. My academic and professional pursuits span risk management, machine learning, and statistical modeling, all tied together by a focus on how mathematical insights can drive advancements in AI and solve real-world problems.</p></li><li class=icon><h2><img src=team/Julia.JPG / class=headshot></h2><h2 style=text-align:center>Head of Events,<br>Julia</h2><p style=text-align:center>As a Bachelor's student in Biomedicine, I’m intrigued by the dynamic relationship between AI and neuroscience. New AI designs can be inspired by the knowledge of neural networks, and conversely, computational knowledge can help create tools to further understand brain function. I find the potential and the intersectionality of these topics very exciting, and hope to be able to share my passion here, at Hub AI.</p></li><li class=icon><h2><img src=team/Fabio.jpeg / class=headshot></h2><h2 style=text-align:center>Head of Development,<br>Fabio</h2><p style=text-align:center>I'm currently studying for a Master's in Social Scientific Data Analysis after finishing my Bachelor's in Sociology. I think it's great that data is becoming more and more important in society thanks to AI. This is changing how we see social relationships and behaviors, giving us some great insights but also raising some ethical questions about privacy and inequality. I'm really interested in how AI affects societal norms and structures. My aim is to use data insights to tackle social challenges in this fast-changing field.</p></li><li class=icon><h2><img src=team/anonymous.png / class=headshot></h2><h2 style=text-align:center>Treasurer,<br>Karin</h2><p style=text-align:center>My interest in AI, as a Bachelor’s student in Business Administration, stems from a perceived lack of focus on the matter in the current curriculum. It is well-known that AI will affect the current roles in many fields by automating and streamlining inefficient processes. I believe that gaining knowledge about the competences expected by employers due to these changes is considered important by many of today’s students. I seek to provide this knowledge through Hub AI, while also learning more about what the future may hold for AI advancements.</p></li><li class=icon><h2><img src=team/anonymous.png / class=headshot></h2><h2 style=text-align:center>Head of Something Else,<br>You?</h2><p style=text-align:center>The Hub AI team is growing!
