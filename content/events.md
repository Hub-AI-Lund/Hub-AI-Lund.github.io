Are we closer to George Orwell's dystopia 1984 than we think? 👀
With social media and advanced camera systems, surveillance is no longer the lonely CCTV on a street corner. AI and other algorithms are applied in many of these systems. But what biases, pitfalls, dangers and chances are accompanying the change that happened “since 1984”?  

Are we living in a surveillance culture? What role do stakeholders play and where can we situate the users? Are we merely passive data generators or can we actively shape the data-generating process? Join us on November 16th at 17:30 to explore these and many more topics in our upcoming panel discussion on AI, security and surveillance. We welcome many new and familiar faces to take part - be it as a quiet listener or an active “input-creating” part in the discussion and free fika afterwards. ☕️🍪  

We secured three great speakers - Yannick Deller, Jakob Stenseke, and Paolo Nardi to explore this topic with us. We will present them further throughout the week, so stay tuned!
