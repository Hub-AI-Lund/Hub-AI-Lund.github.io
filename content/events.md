Are we closer to George Orwell's dystopia 1984 than we think? 👀
With social media and advanced camera systems, surveillance is no longer the lonely CCTV on a street corner. But what biases, pitfalls, dangers and chances are accompanying the change that happened “since 1984”?
📣 Join us on November 16th to explore these topics together with a panel of three great speakers - Yannick Deller, Jakob Stenseke, and Paolo Nardi. We will present them further throughout the week, so stay tuned!
