## Hub AI Talks: The Effectiveness of Digital Contact-Tracing Solutions for Tackling COVID-19
##### :round_pushpin: **Online**
##### :date: **March 3  2021 17:30**
##### :link: [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/183007593262736/)

Many tech forces aim to stop Covid-19 from spreading and 'flatten the curve' of new cases. And contact tracing, which is traditionally done manually, made its way into the digital world. This approach finds out how the virus is spreading within any given population using proximity detection. Simply, the user is notified if there is any risk of crossing paths with someone who has a confirmed case of infection. Does it work? And what kind of challenges does it bring? Viktoriia Shubina, a PhD researcher at Tampere University, will shed some light on digital contact-tracing tech and discuss its limitations.
